# Todo Application

I will be building todo application with functionalities like create new todo , get a list of todos , update todo , delete todo
also will authentication with jwt token

### How to approach this 

- create express server and connect to the database , setup the env variables
- build the database design 
- seed some sample data into the database of todos
- 

 like 

`/api/v1/task/ `
